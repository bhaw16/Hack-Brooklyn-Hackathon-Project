This project is a web app that sends reminder emails based on a selected date. You put in your name, email, your reminder title and your reminder message.
Once you do this, an email will be automatically sent to you in the morning of the scheduled date. There is also a calendar on the side so that you can
see how the days line up and view your events more easily.
## sign-up.html
Former sign up page for the app; we were going to attempt a user sign up and login to be able to access the app and submit a reminder title and message without
having to enter in your email, but we couldn't successfully implement this due to time constraints.
## reminder-app-login.html
Former log in page for the app that users would have had to fill out after signing up to gain access to the app.
## reminder-app.html
HTML for the calendar
## calendar.css
Current CSS stylesheet for the calendar HTML; still a work in progress
