This project is a web app that uses the Google Sheets API to send reminder emails to users, based on a selected date the user enters. The user enters their message and the date they would like to recieve it at, and the email is atuomatically sent the morning of the scheduled date. There is also a calendar that serves as a visual to see the dates for the year more clearly.
